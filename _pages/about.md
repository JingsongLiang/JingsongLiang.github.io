I am currently a research staff at the **National University of Singapore** (NUS), working with [**Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti**](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html) at the **Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Laboratory** and [**Prof. Rodney Teo**](https://temasek-labs.nus.edu.sg/program/program_flightscienceswarm_tsltshr.html) at the **Temasek Laboratories**. Before that, I received my master's degree in computer science from National University of Singapore and my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Northeastern University.

My research focuses on generative and foundation models for cooperative multi-agent learning. I am also working on multi-robot systems and autonomous robotic exploration, navigation, and coverage.

Happy to chat more about relevant research topics and collaborations!
